# Things

Some example things.

## Digital input and output with a Sonoff Basic

Demonstrates the usage of digital inputs ([button](https://www.espruino.com/Button)) and outputs (relays and onboard LED).

### MQTT `command` payloads

- `{"name": "blinkOn"}` - starts blinking the on-board LED.
- `{"name": "blinkOff"}` - stops blinking the on-board LED.
- `{"name": "turnOn"}` - turns the relay on.
- `{"name": "turnOff"}` - turns the relay off.
- `{"name": "toggle"}` - toggles the relay.

### Published `telemetry` (every 30 seconds)

``` json
{
  "freeMemory":640,
  "rssi":-64
}
```

## Analog input and output with an ESP-12E

Demonstrates the usage of analog inputs (a photo resistor = light sensor) and outputs (an LED which is being dimmed).

### MQTT `command` payloads

- `{"name": "blinkOn"}` - starts blinking the on-board LED.
- `{"name": "blinkOff"}` - stops blinking the on-board LED.
- `{"name": "autoDimOn"}` - turns on auto dimming *(dimming of the LED based on the value of the light sensor)*.
- `{"name": "autoDimOff"}` - turns off auto dimming.
- `{"name": "dim", "value": 0.5}` - dims the LED with the provided value of 0 to 1.

### Published `telemetry` (every 5 seconds)

``` json
{
  "freeMemory":640,
  "rssi":-64,
  "light":0.8251953125
}
```
